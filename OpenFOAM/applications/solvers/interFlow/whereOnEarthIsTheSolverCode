The interFlow solver is generated by copying the interFoam solver of the
OpenFOAM version loaded at compile time, renaming it to interFlow and modifying
it to allow running it with isoAdvector instead of MULES.

The modifications are done by the script isoAdvector/bin/generateInterFlow.

For further description of how to run interFlow in isoAdvector mode, see
isoAdvector/README.md.
